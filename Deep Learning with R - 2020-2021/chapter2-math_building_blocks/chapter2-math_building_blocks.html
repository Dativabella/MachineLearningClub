# Chapter 2 Agenda

**Before we begin: the mathematical building blocks of neural networks**

Keras and Tensorflow

A first example of a neural network

Tensors and tensor operations

How neural networks learn via backpropagation and gradient descent

---


# The installation of Keras and Tensorflow

For installing the Keras and Tensorflow, we need to first install the package "keras" and "tensorflow" from CRAN.

--


```r
install.packages("keras")
install.packages("tensorflow")
```

--

Then we need to use the install_tensorflow() and install_keras() to install the core program of these packages.

--


```r
library(tensorflow)
library(keras)
install_tensorflow()
install_keras() 
# we can use the option to install the cpu or gpu based version tensorflow = "1.1.0-gpu"
```

---

# Keras and TensorFlow

**TensorFlow** is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It was developed by Google and first released in 2015.

**Keras** is an Application Programming Interface (API) for the machine learning. It was developed by Francois Chollet in 2015. Keras can actually take many different libraries as the backend engine. TensorFlow became the default backend engine for Keras since v1.1.0. 

---

# MNIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology ) Database

The problem we're trying to solve here is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (28 pixels by 28 pixels) into their 10 categories (0 to 9). We'll use the MNIST dataset, a classic dataset in the machine-learning community, which has been around almost as long as the field itself and has been intensively studied. It's a set of 60,000 training images, plus 10,000 test images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the NIST in MNIST) in the 1980s.

---

# How the MNIST dataset looks like




```r
mnist &lt;- dataset_mnist() 
train_images &lt;- mnist$train$x 
train_labels &lt;- mnist$train$y 
test_images &lt;- mnist$test$x 
test_labels &lt;- mnist$test$y
```

---

`train_images` and `train_labels` form the _training set_, the data that the model will learn from. The model will then be tested on the  _test set_, `test_images` and `test_labels`. The images are encoded as as 3D arrays, and the labels are a 1D array of digits, ranging from 0 to 9. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the images and the labels.

The R `str()` function is a convenient way to get a quick glimpse at the structure of an array. Let's use it to have a look at the training data:


```r
str(train_images)
```


```r
str(train_labels)
```

The workflow will be as follows: first we'll feed the neural network the training data, `train_images` and `train_labels`. The network will then learn to associate images and labels. Finally, we'll ask the network to produce predictions for `test_images`, and we'll verify whether these predictions match the labels from `test_labels`.

---

# Build your first neural network


```r
network &lt;- keras_model_sequential() %&gt;% 
  layer_dense(units = 512, activation = "relu", input_shape = c(28 * 28)) %&gt;% 
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = "softmax")
```

The core building block of neural networks is the _layer_, a data-processing module that you can think of as a filter for data. Some data comes in, and it comes out in a more useful form. Specifically, layers extract _representations_ out of the data fed into them—hopefully representations that are more meaningful for the problem at hand. Most of deep learning consists of chaining together simple layers that will implement a form of progressive _data distillation_. A deep-learning model is like a sieve for data processing, made of a succession of increasingly refined data filters—the layers.

Here our network consists of a sequence of two layers, which are densely connected (also called _fully connected_) neural layers. The second (and last) layer is a 10-way _softmax_ layer, which means it will return an array of 10 probability scores (summing to 1). Each score will be the probability that the current digit image belongs to one of our 10 digit classes.

---

# Complilation

To make the network ready for training, we need to pick three more things, as part of the _compilation_ step:

* _A loss function_—How the network will be able to measure how good a job it's doing on its training data, and thus how it will be able to steer itself in the right direction.
* _An optimizer_—The mechanism through which the network will update itself based on the data it sees and its loss function.
* _Metrics to monitor during training and testing_—Here we'll only care about accuracy (the fraction of the images that were correctly classified).

The exact purpose of the loss function and the optimizer will be made clear throughout the next two chapters.


```r
network %&gt;% compile(
  optimizer = "rmsprop",
  loss = "categorical_crossentropy",
  metrics = c("accuracy")
)
```

---

# Data process

Before training, we'll preprocess the data by reshaping it into the shape the network expects and scaling it so that all values are in the `[0, 1]` interval. Previously, our training images, for instance, were stored in an array of shape `(60000, 28, 28)` of type integer with values in the `[0, 255]` interval. We transform it into a double array of shape `(60000, 28 * 28)` with values between 0 and 1.


```r
train_images &lt;- array_reshape(train_images, c(60000, 28 * 28))
train_images &lt;- train_images / 255

test_images &lt;- array_reshape(test_images, c(10000, 28 * 28))
test_images &lt;- test_images / 255
```

We also need to categorically encode the labels, a step which we explain in chapter 3:


```r
train_labels &lt;- to_categorical(train_labels)
test_labels &lt;- to_categorical(test_labels)
```

---

# Train the NN

We are now ready to train our network, which in Keras is done via a call to the `fit` method of the network: we "fit" the model to its training data.


```r
network %&gt;% fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs = 5, batch_size = 128)
```

--

Two quantities are being displayed during training: the "loss" of the network over the training data, and the accuracy of the network over the training data.

We quickly reach an accuracy of 0.989 (i.e. 98.9%) on the training data. Now let's check that our model performs well on the test set too:

--


```r
metrics &lt;- network %&gt;% evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose = 0)
metrics
```

---

# Data representation in neural network
We will commonly have the 0D to 5D data as a tensor for the NN.

**Vector data ** —2D tensors of shape (samples, features)  
**Timeseries data or sequence data ** —3D tensors of shape (samples, timesteps, features)  
**Images** —4D tensors of shape (samples, height, width, channels) or (samples, channels, height, width)  
**Video—5D** tensors of shape (samples, frames, height, width, channels) or (samples, frames, channels, height, width)  


---

# The gears of neural networks: tensor operations
**Element-wise operations**: operations that are applied independently to each entry in the tensors being considered. This means these operations are highly amenable to massively parallel implementations


```r
naive_relu &lt;- function(x) {
  for (i in nrow(x))
    for (j in ncol(x))
      x[i, j] &lt;- max(x[i, j], 0) x
}
```


```r
z &lt;- pmax(z, 0)  # Some common functions are already have a BLAS implementation in R
```

---

# Operations involving tensors of different dimensions


```r
x &lt;- array(round(runif(1000,0,9)), dim = c(64,3,32,10))
y &lt;- array(5, dim = c(32,10))

z &lt;- sweep(x, c(3,4), y, pmax)
```

---

# Tensor operations: tensor dot

Tensor dot (tensor product) - combines entries in the input tensors, NOT element wise!

Notation: `x %*% y` - on paper you'll see `\(x \cdot y\)`

--

With x and y as vectors...


```r
naive_vector_dot &lt;- function(x, y) {
  z &lt;- 0
  for (i in 1:length(x))
    z &lt;- z + x[[i]] * y[[i]]
  z
}
```

--

With a matrix and a vector:


```r
naive_matrix_vector_dot &lt;- function(x, y) {
  z &lt;- rep(0, nrow(x))
  for (i in 1:nrow(x))
    for (j in 1:ncol(x))
      z[[i]] &lt;- z[[i]] + x[[i, j]] * y[[j]]
  z 
}
```


```r
naive_matrix_vector_dot &lt;- function(x, y) {
  z &lt;- rep(0, nrow(x))
  for (i in 1:nrow(x))
    z[[i]] &lt;- naive_vector_dot(x[i,], y)
  z
}
```

---

# Tensor operations: tensor dot

`x %*% y` is not simmetric!

Generalizing...  
E.g.: two matrices

Works if `ncol(x) == nrow(y)`

--

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/ss_dotproduct.png" alt="" height = 350/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

# Tensor operations: tensor dot


```r
naive_matrix_dot &lt;- function(x, y) {
  z &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = nrow(x), ncol = ncol(y))
  for (i in 1:nrow(x))
    for (j in 1:ncol(y)) {
      row_x &lt;- x[i,]
      column_y &lt;- y[,j]
      z[i, j] &lt;- naive_vector_dot(row_x, column_y)
    } 
  z
}
```

---

# Tensor operations: tensor reshaping

Used especially during preprocessing  
Definition: rearranging its rows and columns to match a target shape  
Nr of coefficients: unchanged


```r
train_images &lt;- array_reshape(train_images, c(60000, 28 * 28))
```

--

`array_reshape()` vs `dim&lt;-()`  
Reinterpreted using row-major semantics vs column-major

--


```r
x &lt;- matrix(c(0, 1,
              2, 3,
              4, 5),
            nrow = 3, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
x
x1 &lt;- array_reshape(x, dim = c(6, 1))
x2 &lt;- array_reshape(x1, dim = c(2, 3))
## vs
x3 &lt;- x1
dim(x3) &lt;- c(2, 3)
```

---

# Tensor operations: tensor reshaping

A special case of reshaping: *transposition* -&gt; exchanging its rows and its columns


```r
x &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = 300, ncol = 20)
dim(x)
x &lt;- t(x)
dim(x)
```

---
        
# Tensor operations: A geometric interpretation 

All tensor operations have a geometric interpretation.  
Addition. 

`A = [0.5, 1.0], B = [1, 0.25]`

# Tensor operations: A geometric interpretation 

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/ss_geom_int_2.png" alt="" height = 200/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

--

**Addition**: chaining together the vector arrows, with the resulting location being the vector representing the sum of the two vectors

--

Elementary geometric operations (affine transformations, rotations, scaling) can also be expressed as tensor operations. 


```r
R &lt;- matrix(c("cos(theta)", "-sin(theta)",
            "sin(theta)", "-cos(theta)"),
            nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
R
```

---

# Deep learning: a geometric interpration

Neural networks: (very large) chains of tensor operations, each a geometric transformation of the input data. 

--

Neural network ~ "a very complex geometric transformation in a high-dimensional space, implemented via a long series of simple steps"

![](images/ss_geom_dl.png)

--

A neural network tries to figure out a transformation of the paper ball that would uncrumple it, so as to make the two classes cleanly separable again. 

--

Deep learning: tries to achieve this with a series of simple transformations of the 3D space

Machine learning is all about finding neat representations for complex, highly folded data manifolds.


---

# The engine of neural networks: gradient-based optimization

`relu`: REctifier Linear Unit - `relu(x) = max(0, x)`


```r
output = relu(dot(W, input) + b)
```

--

W and b are tensors (attributes of the layer), the **weights** or **trainable parameters**, containing the information learned by the network from exposure to training data.

--

Initially, filled with small random values

Next: gradual adjustments of these weights, based on a feedback signal (**training**)

---

# Gradient-based optimization

Training loop:

--

1. Draw a batch of training samples x and corresponding targets y. (just I/O code)
1. Run the network on x (a step called the forward pass) to obtain predictions y_pred.
1. Compute the loss of the network on the batch, a measure of the mismatch between y_pred and y. (a handful of tensor operations)
1. Update all weights of the network in a way that slightly reduces the loss on this batch. (the hard part!)

--

How can we compute whether the coefficient should be increased or decreased, and by how much?

--

**Tired:** freeze all, except one, try out values, REPEAT FOR ALL COEFFICIENTS (1k-1M!)

**Wired:** all operations used in the network are differentiable, we can compute the gradient of the loss with regard to the network's coefficients.

--

Then, _just_ move the coefficients in the opposite direction from the gradient, decreasing the loss.

---

# What's a derivative?

`f(x) = y`, continuous, smooth function 

_Continuous:_ `f(x + epsilon_x) = y + epsilon_y`

_Smooth:_ valid approximation `f(x + epsilon_x) = y + a * epsilon_x`, close to point `p`

--

Slope `a`: the **derivative** of f in p  
a &gt; 0: f(x) increases + magnitude of a tells how quickly it does

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/ss_derivative.png" alt="" height = 160/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

--

What's in it for DL?  
We update x by a factor epsilon_x in order to minimize f(x), and we know the derivative of f -&gt; job done! Just move x a little in the opposite direction from the derivative!

---

# Derivative of a tensor operation

**Gradient**: the derivative of a tensor operation

```
y_pred = dot(W, x)
loss_value = loss(y_pred, y)
```

--

x and y are frozen, so we have `loss_value = f(W)`

Remember the derivative: slope of the curve of f  
Gradient `f(W0)` is the tensor describing the **curvature** of f(W) around W0

--

So, for f(W), we can reduce f(W) by moving W in the opposite direction from the gradient!

`W1 = W0 - step * gradient(f)(W0)`, where step is a small scaling factor

---

# Stochastic Gradient Descent

Minimum: the point where the derivative is 0

For our neural networks: we find analytically the combination of weight values that yields the smallest possible loss function - intractable for real neural networks (k-M parameters!)

--

Instead (mini-batch stochastic gradient descent)

1. Draw a batch of training samples `x` and corresponding targets `y`.
1. Run the network on `x` to obtain predictions `y_pred`.
1. Compute the loss of the network on the batch, a measure of the mismatch between `y_pred` and `y`.
1. Compute the gradient of the loss with regard to the network's parameters (a backward pass).
1. Move the parameters a little in the opposite direction from the gradient

---

# Stochastic Gradient Descent

In 1D...

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/ss_sgd.png" alt="" height = 300/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Important: appropriate step! Not too small, not too large!

Mini-batch: a compromise between single samples (true SGD) vs all samples (batch SGD).

---

# Stochastic Gradient Descent

2D:

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/ss_sgd_2d.png" alt="" height = 300/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Now: _just_ scale up to a 1000000-dimensional space ;)

---

# Stochastic Gradient Descent

Variants of SGD: taking into account previous weight updates when computing the next weight update, rather than just looking at the current value of the gradients (`momentum`).

Examples: Adagrad, RMSProp, and several others (called _optimizers_).

--

Advantages: convergence speed and local minima

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/ss_sgd_minima.png" alt="" height = 300/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


---

# Stochastic Gradient Descent

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/ss_sgd_minima.png" alt="" height = 300/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Optimization ~ a small ball rolling down the loss curve:  
With enough momentum, not stuck in the local minimum!

--

Implementation: updating the parameter `w` based not only on the current gradient value but also on the previous parameter update

```
velocity &lt;- past_velocity * momentum + learning_rate * gradient
w &lt;- w + momentum * velocity - learning_rate * gradient
```

---

# Chaining derivatives: backpropagation

A function is differentiable -&gt; we can compute the derivative

Many tensor operations, chained together, with simple &amp; known derivatives -&gt; 

```
f(W1, W2, W3) = a(W1, b(W2, c(W3)))
```

--

Chain rule: `\(f(g(x))=f'(g(x))*g'(x)\)`  
--&gt; + neural network -&gt; Backpropagation (also called reverse-mode differentiation)

Start: final loss value, then backwards to the bottom layers to compute the contribution that each parameter had in the loss value.

--

Modern frameworks (TensorFlow) are capable of *symbolic differentiation* - i.e. the gradient can be computed, and a simple call to this function *is* already the backwards pass.  
And this has not even to be done by hand!

---

# Our very first example

What's going on?

--

The **input data**:


```r
library(keras)
mnist &lt;- dataset_mnist()
train_images &lt;- mnist$train$x
train_images &lt;- array_reshape(train_images, c(60000, 28 * 28))
train_images &lt;- train_images / 255
test_images &lt;- mnist$test$x
test_images &lt;- array_reshape(test_images, c(10000, 28 * 28))
test_images &lt;- test_images / 255
```

---

# Our very first example

The **network**:


```r
network &lt;- keras_model_sequential() %&gt;%
  layer_dense(units = 512, activation = "relu", input_shape = c(28*28)) %&gt;%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = "softmax")
```

--

Chain of two dense layers, with simple tensor operations  

Pipe: makes code more readable ("stacking", "then")  

--

Normally: "just for compactness"  
Here: the models are modified in-place

```
network %&gt;% 
  yadda_yadda()

# WE ARE MODIFYING NETWORK!
## no need to say 
network &lt;- yadda_yadda(network)
```

---

# Our very first example
 
The **compilation step**:


```r
network %&gt;% compile(
  optimizer = "rmsprop",
  loss = "categorical_crossentropy",
  metrics = c("accuracy")
)
```

--

`categorical_crossentropy` is the loss function in use, the one we attempt to minimize via mini- batch stochastic gradient descent. 

-&gt; this works well in tasks of classification

---

# Our very first example

The **training loop**:


```r
network %&gt;% fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs = 5, batch_size = 128)
```

--

The network will start to iterate on the training data in mini-batches of 128 samples, 5 times over.

Total: (60000/128)*5 gradient updates (2345), with loss sufficiently low and hi-enough accuracy!

---

# Summary

- **Learning**: finding a combination of model parameters that minimizes a loss function for a given set of training data samples and their corresponding targets.

--

- Learning **happens** by drawing random batches of data samples and their targets, and computing the gradient of the network parameters with respect to the loss on the batch. The network parameters are then moved a bit in the opposite direction from the gradient.(how much? f(learning rate))

--

- The entire learning process is made possible by the fact that neural networks are **chains of differentiable tensor operations** -&gt; chain rule of derivation is applicable!

--

- Two key concepts (more in chapters to come): 
  - **loss** quantity to minimize during training (measure of success for the task)
  - **optimizers**, specifying how the gradient of the loss will be used to update parameters
